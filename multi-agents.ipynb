    "#### This is a simple experiment of CrewAI mutli-agent system\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains a script that demonstrates the usage of various tools and agents from the `crewai` and `crewai_tools` libraries. The script showcases the capabilities of these libraries in performing tasks related to AI research and content writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script begins by importing necessary modules and defining variables. It then creates instances of agents, such as a Senior Researcher and a Writer, each with specific roles and goals. These agents are equipped with tools like the SerperDevTool, DirectoryReadTool, and FileReadTool, which enable them to perform tasks such as searching the internet, listing files in a directory, and reading the content of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script also defines tasks, such as researching the next big trend in AI and composing an insightful article on a specific topic. These tasks are assigned to the respective agents, who utilize their tools and knowledge to accomplish the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the script, the usage of these tools, agents, and tasks is demonstrated, showcasing their functionalities and interactions. The script provides an overview of how the `crewai` and `crewai_tools` libraries can be utilized to streamline AI research and content creation workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this script serves as a practical example of how to leverage the capabilities of the `crewai` and `crewai_tools` libraries to enhance productivity and efficiency in AI-related tasks."
